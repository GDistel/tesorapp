# Tesorapp server

This is the back-end for the shared expenses app Tesorapp.
It can be used online at `https://tesorapp.netlify.app` but it can also be installed as a PWA for a better experience.

Test user: `tesorapp-test`
Test password: `###Aa123`

Allow for some time for the heroku free server to wake up on the very first request.
